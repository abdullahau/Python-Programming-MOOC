#### Discord

Discord is a communication platform which allows both text-based and voice/video chats. You can find out more about the platform [on the Discord website](https://discord.com/).

The course channels are available through [this link](https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/ohjelmoinnin_mooc). See especially the `ohjelmoinnin_mooc_english` and the `ohjelmoinnin_mooc_voice` channels for support in English.

Instructor will be on standby on the course channels in Discord at guidance time. Instructor will also reply to questions sent via private messages. Discord also has a discussion about the course outside of the guidance hours, so itâ€™s worth joining!
